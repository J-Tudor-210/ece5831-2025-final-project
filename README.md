This project was completed to implement an American Sign Language (ASL) Recognition System for predicting hand signs in the ASL alphabet.
A model was trained using Python cide in VS Code and Jupyter nitebook with a dataset fearuring 5200 labeled images. A custom dataset was 
created using 26 letters captured agsinst against a white background. Real-Time recognition of hand signed letters was performed to assess 
predictive accuracy and confidence scores. a Confusion Matrix was created to determine which letters were challenging based on the numbet of 
true positives and false postives observed.
